Hello everyone
In this Terraform project, our objective is to provision an AWS EC2 instance, an S3 bucket, and an AWS DynamoDB table in the AWS cloud infrastructure using Terraform. 
As part of our best practices, we will be storing our Terraform state file in the S3 bucket, which will serve as our backend for managing state information.
